## multi.layer.perceptron
Multilayer Perceptron Nerual Network example

This repository contains all the files needed to run a multilayer perceptron network and actually get a probalbility 
for a digit image from MNIST dataset.

##To run this model you need Linux/ Windows
1. Python 2 or 3 installed with Anaconda 2/3
2. Install TensorFlow
3. Install Keras
4. Download the project.
5. Run python in command line with argument of the multylayer erceptron network.
6. Enjoy
